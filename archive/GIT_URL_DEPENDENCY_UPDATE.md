# Git URL Dependency Update ‚úÖ

## What Changed

Per your excellent suggestion, I've updated the dependency declaration from a local file path to a git URL:

### Before (Local Path) ‚ùå
```toml
dependencies = [
    "llm_call @ file:///home/graham/workspace/experiments/claude_max_proxy",
]
```

### After (Git URL) ‚úÖ
```toml
dependencies = [
    "llm_call @ git+https://github.com/grahama1970/claude_max_proxy.git@master",
]
```

## Why This is Much Better

1. **Portability**: Works on any machine, not just yours
2. **Collaboration**: Team members can easily install and contribute
3. **CI/CD Ready**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc. can install it
4. **Version Control**: Can pin to specific branches, tags, or commits
5. **Standard Practice**: This is how modern Python projects handle dependencies

## Installation is Now Universal

```bash
# Anyone, anywhere can now install with:
pip install git+https://github.com/grahama1970/claude-test-reporter.git

# It will automatically get claude_max_proxy from GitHub too!
```

## Examples of Version Pinning

```toml
# Latest from main branch
"llm_call @ git+https://github.com/grahama1970/claude_max_proxy.git@main"

# Specific tag/release
"llm_call @ git+https://github.com/grahama1970/claude_max_proxy.git@v1.2.3"

# Specific commit for reproducibility
"llm_call @ git+https://github.com/grahama1970/claude_max_proxy.git@abc123def456"

# Feature branch during development
"llm_call @ git+https://github.com/grahama1970/claude_max_proxy.git@feature/gemini-2.5"
```

## This Solves Multiple Problems

### Problem 1: Machine-Specific Paths ‚ùå
```python
# Old code had hardcoded paths
self.claude_max_proxy_path = Path("/home/graham/workspace/experiments/claude_max_proxy")
```

### Solution: Standard Python Imports ‚úÖ
```python
# Now just works with normal imports
from llm_call.core.llm_client import LLMClient
```

### Problem 2: Collaboration Difficulty ‚ùå
Other developers couldn't use the code without recreating your exact directory structure.

### Solution: Universal Installation ‚úÖ
Anyone can now `pip install` and start using immediately.

### Problem 3: CI/CD Integration ‚ùå
GitHub Actions would fail because the path doesn't exist on GitHub's servers.

### Solution: Git URLs Work Everywhere ‚úÖ
```yaml
- run: pip install git+https://github.com/grahama1970/claude-test-reporter.git
```

## Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**: Make sure both repos are pushed
2. **Test Installation**: Try installing on a different machine
3. **Update Other Projects**: Apply same pattern to other projects
4. **Consider PyPI**: Eventually publish to PyPI for even easier installation

Thank you for the suggestion - this makes the project much more professional and shareable! üöÄ
