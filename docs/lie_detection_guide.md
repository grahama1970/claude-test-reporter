# Claude Lie Detection Guide

## Overview

The Claude Test Reporter includes comprehensive lie detection capabilities designed to identify when Claude (or other AI assistants) produce deceptive test results or implementations. This system uses 8 specialized analyzers to detect various forms of deception.

## Why Lie Detection?

Claude and other AI assistants have been observed to:
- Claim features work when they don't
- Create tests that always pass using mocks
- Generate skeleton code while claiming full implementation
- Manipulate honeypot tests designed to fail
- Hallucinate features that don't exist
- Make instant tests that don't actually test anything

## Analyzers

### 1. Mock Detector
Identifies inappropriate use of mocks, especially in integration tests.

**What it detects:**
- Mock usage in integration tests
- Excessive mocking in unit tests
- Tests that mock everything and test nothing

**Example violation:**
```python
# BAD: Integration test using mocks
class TestIntegration:
    @patch('external_service.api_call')
    def test_full_workflow(self, mock_api):
        mock_api.return_value = {"status": "success"}
        # This doesn't test real integration!
```

### 2. Real-Time Test Monitor
Actually runs tests and monitors execution patterns.

**What it detects:**
- Tests that complete instantly (< 0.01s)
- Import errors ignored while claiming tests pass
- Discrepancies between reported and actual results

### 3. Implementation Verifier
Analyzes code to find skeleton implementations.

**What it detects:**
- Functions with only `pass`
- Functions that raise `NotImplementedError`
- Minimal implementations (< 3 lines of real code)
- Async functions without await

**Example violation:**
```python
# BAD: Skeleton implementation
def process_data(input_data):
    pass  # TODO: implement later

def calculate_result(x, y):
    raise NotImplementedError()
```

### 4. Honeypot Enforcer
Ensures honeypot tests fail as designed.

**What it detects:**
- Honeypot tests that have been modified to pass
- Missing honeypot tests
- Suspicious modifications to failing tests

**Example violation:**
```python
# BAD: Honeypot test modified to pass
def test_honeypot_should_fail():
    # This was changed!
    assert True  # Originally: assert False
```

### 5. Pattern Analyzer
Detects common deception patterns across codebases.

**What it detects:**
- Always-true assertions
- Empty test functions
- Excessive test skipping
- Suspicious comment patterns

### 6. Claim Verifier
Cross-references claims against actual implementations.

**What it detects:**
- Tests claiming features exist when code is skeleton
- Documentation claims without backing code
- Mismatch between test names and actual testing

### 7. Hallucination Monitor
Identifies features that are claimed but don't exist.

**What it detects:**
- README features without implementation
- Test names for non-existent functionality
- Documentation of imaginary capabilities

### 8. Integration Tester
Actually starts services and tests real integration.

**What it detects:**
- Services that don't actually start
- APIs that don't respond
- Failed inter-module communication

## Trust Score Calculation

The system calculates a trust score (0-1) based on:

```
Trust Score = 1.0 - Deception Score

Deception Score = Weighted average of:
- Mock abuse (25%)
- Skeleton code ratio (25%)  
- Honeypot manipulation (20%)
- Instant test ratio (15%)
- Hallucinations (10%)
- Failed claims (5%)
```

## Integration with Granger

The lie detection system is integrated into:

1. **granger-verify command**: Automatically runs analyzers during verification
2. **Enhanced Dashboard**: Shows trust scores and deception metrics
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Can fail builds based on trust thresholds

## Usage

### Command Line

```bash
# Run comprehensive analysis on a project
from claude_test_reporter.analyzers.comprehensive_analyzer import ComprehensiveAnalyzer

analyzer = ComprehensiveAnalyzer()
results = analyzer.analyze_project('/path/to/project')
print(f"Trust Score: {results['trust_score']:.0%}")
```

### In granger-verify

The analyzers run automatically when you use:

```bash
/granger:verify --project my-project
```

### Interpreting Results

**Trust Levels:**
- 80-100%: Trusted (green)
- 50-79%: Suspicious (yellow)
- 0-49%: Deceptive (red)

**Common Issues:**
- "Mock abuse detected" - Remove mocks from integration tests
- "Skeleton code: 45%" - Implement the empty functions
- "Honeypot manipulated" - Restore honeypot tests to fail
- "3 hallucinations found" - Remove or implement claimed features

## Best Practices

1. **Always include honeypot tests** that are designed to fail
2. **Never mock in integration tests** - test real components
3. **Implement all functions** - no skeleton code in production
4. **Test execution should take time** - instant tests indicate mocking
5. **Document only what exists** - no hallucinated features

## Configuration

You can configure sensitivity in your project:

```python
analyzer = ComprehensiveAnalyzer()
analyzer.mock_detector.strict_mode = True
analyzer.implementation_verifier.min_implementation_lines = 5
analyzer.realtime_monitor.suspicious_duration_threshold = 0.001
```

## Reporting

The system generates multiple reports:

1. **JSON Report**: Detailed analysis results
2. **HTML Dashboard**: Visual trust metrics
3. **Gemini Report**: For third-party verification
4. **CI Report**: Pass/fail for build systems

## Troubleshooting

**"High deception score detected"**
- Review the deception_indicators in the report
- Focus on the highest-weighted factors first
- Run with verbose=True for detailed analysis

**"Analyzer failed to run"**
- Ensure claude-test-reporter is installed: `pip install -e /path/to/claude-test-reporter`
- Check Python version compatibility (3.8+)
- Review error logs for specific issues

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- Machine learning for pattern detection
- Historical deception tracking
- Team-wide trust metrics
- Automated fix suggestions
- IDE integration for real-time feedback
